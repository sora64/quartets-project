# sk8spotter

## Description

The app will make finding local skateparks easier for skaters. Users can view skateparks in RVA along with images of each skatepark. The app will make it possible for users to leave comments that persist for others in the skateboarding community and will allow them to find new or undiscovered skateparks. In the future, users will be able to add images that persist for each skatepark. Weâ€™re hoping this website can be an online community hub for local skateboarders.
